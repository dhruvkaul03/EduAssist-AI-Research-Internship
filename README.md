# 🧠 EduAssist – AI Research Internship Project

This project is part of my AI Research Internship, where I developed an AI-powered assistant to help students extract and understand information from academic PDFs. The system combines OCR, semantic search, and large language models to deliver accurate answers and summaries.

### 🔍 Problem Statement

Students often struggle to navigate long, complex academic documents. EduAssist automates the extraction and querying process using OCR and a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline backed by Mixtral.

### 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Python** – Core language for the pipeline  
- **Mixtral LLM** (by Mistral AI) – Used for answer generation and summarization  
- **LangChain** – Framework for building the RAG pipeline  
- **FAISS** – Vector similarity search for fast document retrieval  
- **PyMuPDF** – Extracts structured text from PDFs  
- **EasyOCR** – Handles image-based PDF content

### 📁 Project Structure

- `ocr/` → OCR pipeline for scanned PDFs using PyMuPDF + EasyOCR  
- `rag/` → RAG pipeline setup using LangChain, FAISS, and Mixtral  
- `notebooks/` → Experimentation and pipeline testing  
- `data/` → Sample PDFs for testing  
- `main.py` → End-to-end pipeline driver

### 👨‍💻 My Role

- Built OCR pipeline to handle scanned academic PDFs  
- Implemented RAG architecture using LangChain, FAISS, and Mixtral  
- Designed, tested, and refined prompt workflows for QA and summarization  
- Created scalable text extraction and chunking mechanisms  
- Evaluated response accuracy and system latency
