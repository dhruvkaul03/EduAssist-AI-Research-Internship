# 🧠 EduAssist – AI Research Internship Project

A research project focused on developing an AI-powered assistant to help students extract insights from academic PDFs using OCR, RAG pipelines, and LLMs.

---

### 🔍 Problem Statement

Many students struggle to extract meaningful information from dense academic papers. EduAssist aims to automate this process using OCR and LLM-powered question-answering.

---

### 🛠 Tech Stack

- Python, OpenAI GPT-4
- LangChain, FAISS
- EasyOCR, PyMuPDF
- Streamlit (for deployment)

---

### 📁 Project Modules

- `ocr/` → Extracts text from image-based PDFs using OCR  
- `rag/` → Implements Retrieval-Augmented Generation using vector stores  
- `notebooks/` → Prototyping and experimentation  
- `main.py` → End-to-end pipeline
